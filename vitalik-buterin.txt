Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and writer primarily known as a co-founder of Ethereum and a co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine.

Buterin is a co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, described as a “decentralized mining network and software development platform rolled into one” that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single blockchain (a cryptographic transaction ledger). Buterin first described Ethereum in a white paper in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed the development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.

About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: “I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians, and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week.” However, in a 2018 New Yorker article, his father suggests that Buterin is trying to avoid the focus on him as the philosopher king of the blockchain world. “He is trying to focus his time on research,” Dmitry [Buterin’s father] said. “He’s not too excited that the community assigns so much importance to him. He wants the community to be more resilient
